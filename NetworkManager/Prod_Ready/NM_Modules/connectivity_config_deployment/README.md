# Connectivity Configuration Module

This module creates a connectivity configuration in Azure Network Manager to establish hub and spoke network topology.

## Features

- Creates a hub and spoke connectivity configuration
- Links the hub virtual network to spoke network groups
- Uses consistent naming conventions

## Usage

```hcl
module "connectivity_config" {
  source = "./modules/connectivity_config"

  name = "HubAndSpoke"
  network_manager_id = "/subscriptions/subscription_id/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkManagers/example-nm"
  region = "israelcentral"
  hub_id = "/subscriptions/subscription_id/resourceGroups/hub-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/hub-vnet"
  network_group_id = "/subscriptions/subscription_id/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkManagers/example-nm/networkGroups/spoke-group"
}
```

## Input Variables

| Name | Description | Type | Required |
|------|-------------|------|:--------:|
| name | The name of the connectivity configuration | string | yes |
| network_manager_id | The ID of the Network Manager | string | yes |
| region | The Azure region where resources will be created | string | yes |
| hub_id | The ID of the hub virtual network | string | yes |
| network_group_id | The ID of the network group containing spoke networks | string | yes |

## Resources Created

- Network Manager Connectivity Configuration (Hub and Spoke type)
- Network Manager Connectivity Group (linking hub to spoke network group)

## Dependencies

This module depends on:
- An existing Network Manager
- An existing hub virtual network
- An existing network group containing spoke networks
- The naming module for consistent resource naming

## Notes

- This module creates a hub and spoke topology in Azure Network Manager
- After applying this configuration, you must manually deploy it in the Azure Portal
- The hub virtual network will be connected to all spoke networks in the specified network group
- The module uses the AzAPI provider for resource creation

## Post-Deployment Steps

After deploying this module, you need to manually apply the connectivity configuration in the Azure Portal:

1. Navigate to the Network Manager in the Azure Portal
2. Go to "Configurations" â†’ "Connectivity configurations"
3. Select the connectivity configuration created by this module
4. Click "Deploy to network"
5. Select the appropriate network group and click "Deploy"
