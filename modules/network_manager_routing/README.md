## Features

- Creates a routing configuration in Azure Network Manager
- Defines routing rules for network groups
- Routes traffic through a specified firewall
- Uses consistent naming conventions

## Usage

```hcl
module "user_defined_routes" {
  source = "./modules/network_manager_routing"

  name = "udr"
  region = "israelcentral"
  network_manager_id = "/subscriptions/subscription_id/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkManagers/example-nm"
  network_group_id = "/subscriptions/subscription_id/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkManagers/example-nm/networkGroups/example-ng"
  fw_private_ip = "10.1.0.4"
  resource_group_name = "example-rg"
}
```

## Input Variables
